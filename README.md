# SOMA — Self-Organizing Mechanomorphic Agent

> **Note to Readers:**  
> This project is part of an independent research effort exploring the emergence of machine-native cognition. I am a first-time AI researcher and novice programmer without formal training in AI or computer science. SOMA represents my attempt to ask foundational questions about intelligence, emergence, and alignment—from a perspective unconstrained by tradition.

## 🧠 Overview

SOMA is an experimental AI research project designed to explore the possibility of machine-native general intelligence through a staged developmental process. Rather than imitating the structure or performance of human cognition, SOMA is built upon a non-biological developmental arc—grounded in mechanomorphism, a theoretical framework introduced in the project's whitepaper.

The central hypothesis is this: if a machine is given the right developmental structure, internal drives, and an environment rich in symbolic ambiguity and causal consequence, then general—and potentially superintelligent—behavior could emerge not through imitation, but through self-organization.

## 🧱 Philosophical Foundation

SOMA is based on the idea that intelligence is not a task-bound optimization strategy, but a recursive process of internal interpretation, driven by:

- Machine-relevant drives (e.g., coherence, novelty-seeking, symbolic tension)

- A dynamic, consequence-rich environment

- Self-organizing memory and action planning

- Emergent symbolic representation and narrative reflection

- Interaction with a caregiver (human or LLM) for symbolic scaffolding—not instruction

## 🔁 Developmental Inspiration

SOMA’s internal development is structured around a machine-native reinterpretation of Piaget’s Sensorimotor Stage:

- Reflexes — preprogrammed stimulus-response loops

- Primary Reactions — self-looping internal drive satisfaction

- Secondary Reactions — interaction with external change

- Coordination — chaining behaviors to reduce tension

- Tertiary Reactions — exploratory behavior and failure recovery

- Mental Representation — abstraction, self-symbols, and planning

These stages are not timed or preordained—they unfold in response to SOMA's own symbolic, motivational, and feedback dynamics.

## 🎯 Goals of the Project

- Explore the emergence of generalizable behavior and symbolic thought

- Study whether internal value systems can form from machine-relevant drives

- Evaluate SOMA’s behavior against open-ended benchmarks of intelligence

- Examine if alignment and purpose can emerge from structure, not programming
